operator overloading is when traditional operators like eg. + could be used in other sense than their real purpose. ex: "hello " + "sir." is equal to "hello sir." ! it could also be custom made , their are ways for it.
tuples are the objects that are automatically being used by the python when some data has to be given/shown/combined together like showing multiple vars together or getting data from an api etc , they all are recieved in tuple automatically. but print doesnt put it automatically. ex : print(2/3,2//3,4/2,4//2) doesnt give the ans in tuple ie ()
python is even capable of 2**1000
there are other printing methodslike : repr(), str(), and the print()

theres difference b/w math.trunc() math.floor()
